# Geely-Car-Price-Prediction

This data science contest was hosted on kaggle by a chinese automobile company GEELY. Geely Auto aspired to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and to produce cars locally. The goal was to model the price of cars with the available independent variables & to determine the correlation between different variables. By utilizing this I drew to a conclusion of which variables are the most correlated to the price of the car. Lastly, I was required to predict the price of cars in the test data provided by them.
